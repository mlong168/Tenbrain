CccP - Cloud cost control Platform

Do you know what it will cost you each month to deploy to the Cloud? One of the most frustrating and complex parts about the cloud is not how you get stuff running, itâ€™s trying to figure out how much that will cost once you do get it running. With Tenbrains CccP, you no longer need to worry about that. You simply input what your expected monthly budget and Tenbrain takes care of the rest. Tenbrains CccP will automatically select the most competitive Cloud provider to deploy your infrastructure on. Or it will deploy across multiple cloud providers, automatically integrating your applications stacks- CccP does for Cloud IT budgeting what the Cloud did for the data center.
